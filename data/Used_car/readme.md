# Used car data from UK

If you download/use the data set I'd appreciate an up vote, cheers.

## Updated
Scraped data of used cars listings. 100,000 listings, which have been separated into files corresponding to each car manufacturer. I collected the data to make a tool to predict how much my friend should sell his old car for compared to other stuff on the market, and then just extended the data set. Then made a more general car value regression model.

## previous version
Picked two fairly common cars on the British market for analysis (Ford Focus and Mercedes C Class). The hope is to find info such as: when is the ideal time to sell certain cars (i.e. at what age and mileage are there significant drops in resale value). Also can make comparisons between the two, and make a classifier for a ford or Mercedes car. Can easily add more makes and models, so comment for any request e.g. if you want a big data set of all Mercedes makes and models.

## Content
The cleaned data set contains information of price, transmission, mileage, fuel type, road tax, miles per gallon (mpg), and engine size. I've removed duplicate listings and cleaned the columns, but have included a notebook showing the process and the original data for anyone who wants to check/improve my work.

## Inspiration
It'd be cool to have some insights and visualisations of the data. Also, am open to ideas on how to expand the data set.
