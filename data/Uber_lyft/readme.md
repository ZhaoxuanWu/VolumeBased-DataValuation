# Uber vs Lyft

This is a very beginner-friendly dataset. It does contain a lot of NA values. It is a good dataset if you want to use a Linear Regression Model to see the pattern between different predectors such as hour and price.

A really amazing part of this dataset is that I have included the corresponding weather data for that hour with a short summary of the weather. Other important factors are temperature, wind, and sunset.
